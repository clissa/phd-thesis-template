\section{Model architecture}
\label{model_architecture}

This section describes the four architectures adopted for our studies.
In particular, we tap into two network families commonly used for segmentation tasks, i.e. Unet and ResUnet, and experiment with two alternative implementations for each family.
The following subsections discuss the two families and each architecture in greater detail.
