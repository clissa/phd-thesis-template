\label{chap:partI_intro}

Deep Learning models, and in particular Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) \cite{jimenez, greenspan}, have shown the ability to outperform the state-of-the-art in many computer vision applications in the past decade. 
Successful examples range from classification and detection of basically any kind of objects \cite{AlexNet, YOLO} to generative models for image reconstruction \cite{reconstruction} and super-resolution \cite{super-resolution}.
Thus, researchers from both academy and industry have started to explore adopting these techniques in fields such as medical imaging and bioinformatics, where the potential impact is vast.
For instance, CNNs have been employed for identification and localization of tumours \cite{brain_tumor,breast_cancer, ciresan2012deep, cirecsan2013mitosis}, as well as detection of other structures like lung nodules \cite{lung_nodules, meraj2020lung, su2021lung}, skin and breast cancer, diabetic foot \cite{TL_medical_imaging}, colon-rectal polyps \cite{korbar} and more, showing great potential in detecting and classifying biological features \cite{lundervold, sahiner, yadav}.

In the wake of this line of applied research, \Cref{partI} tackles the problem of counting cells into fluorescent microscopy pictures.
