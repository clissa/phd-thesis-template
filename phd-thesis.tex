\begin{dedication} % this is optional
To my parents, who were my foremost motivation.

To don Bruno, who taught me that even mistakes may lead to some good when done with the right intent.
\end{dedication}

\begin{initial_quote} % this is optional

The future of data analysis can involve great progress, the overcoming of real difficulties, and the provision of a great service to all fields of science and technology. Will it? That remains to us, to our willingness to take up the rocky road of real problems in preference to the smooth road of unreal assumptions, arbitrary criteria, and abstract results without real attachments. 

Who is for the challenge?

Undertaking a PhD program in an interdisciplinary field and focusing on various research areas at the intersection of different application domains has presented several challenges but also thrilling growth opportunities.

For this reason, I am deeply grateful to my supervisor, Antonio Zoccoli, who believed in me to initiate a line of research centered around artificial intelligence and data science in Bologna. Without his trust, support and vision, this would not have been possible, and I am sure my professional and personal life would have been much different.
Another big thank you goes to my co-supervisor, Lorenzo Rinaldi, for his advice, continuous support, and patience during my PhD study. I truly appreciated his open-mindedness when considering my requests regarding research topics and training opportunities. Even more, his trust in my technical and organizational capabilities was fundamental during the writing of the thesis, allowing me to work peacefully at my own pace and deliver good results despite tight deadlines.

Then, I am profoundly grateful to the INFN and ATLAS Bologna, from the coordinators to all the nice people I had the luck to share my daily activity with. They created a productive work environment and provided me with many opportunities, instruments, and financial resources that enriched my research activities. A special mention goes to Benedetto Giacobbe and Roberto Spighi for helping me shaping better my research project; Mauro Villa for his support in the first part of my PhD; Roberto Morelli for our fruitful discussions and his crucial contributions to our research; Marco Dalla, with whom I shared part of my academic activities; Silvia Biondi and Giuseppe Carratta, for their selfless help and for being of \textit{key} importance; Riccardo Ridolfi for his competent and thoughtful support concerning academy and its mechanisms; Daniele Manuzzi and Serena Maccolini for sharing lovely moments in the office.

A warm thank you then goes to Marco Luppi and all his team, particularly Fabio Squarcio and Timna Hitrec, for their collaboration in an exciting interdisciplinary project.
My gratitude also extends to the whole Operational Intelligence collaboration that sustained me during my stay at CERN. In particular, Alessandro Di Girolamo and Federica Legger for their guidance and coordination; Mario Lassnig for his wise indications and timely supervision; Mayank Sharma and Panos Paparrigopoulos for their precious advice about coding; Jaroslava Schovancov√° for her kindness and collaborative spirit, and Maria Grigorieva for the compelling discussions about our research projects.

A big thank you then goes to Iota for her precious aid with the bureaucracy. Amid many hardships of a nascent PhD program, her extreme availability and kindness made my experience much smoother. Her care for each of us was priceless, and I wish all PhD students to encounter a figure like her in their paths.

Finally, the most heartfelt acknowledgment goes to all my friends and family, who shared with me much more than my academic journey. 
To my friend and colleague Antonio, without whom I would have never applied for this PhD. More than that, his hard work and will to overcome hampers have been inspiring to me, and our collaboration gave me a real sense of purpose that helped me go through the ups and downs of my research path.
To my dear Elena, for always being on my side, cheering me up and accommodating my needs. Her work ethic and dedication constituted a shining example of how to navigate through the uncertainty of life, set goals and commit to them. Knowing I can always count on her in moments of need has been reassuring during these years.
To my lifelong friends, who are always there for me despite the distance and the little time spent together.
Last but not least, the most profound, passionate and deserved thanksgiving is for my parents and my two brothers. They ensured me a life of dreams through their hard work and waivers. Their unconditional love, trust and support allowed me to proceed flawlessly, focusing on my goals without worries and distractions.

I sincerely believe I deserve little merit for this achievement, for which I owe the greatest part of the credit to all these people who contributed with their hopes, advice, trust and efforts. None of this would have been possible without them.
