abstract = {La Fisica delle Alte Energie (HEP) {\`e} da lungo tra i precursori nel gestire e processare enormi dataset scientifici e nell'operare alcuni tra i pi{\`u} grandi data centre per applicazioni scientifiche.
HEP ha sviluppato una griglia computazionale (Grid) per il calcolo al Large Hadron Collider (LHC) del CERN di Ginevra, che attualmente coordina giornalmente le operazioni di calcolo su oltre 800k processori in 170 centri di calcolo e gestendo mezzo Exabyte di dati su disco distribuito in 5 continenti.

Nelle prossime fasi di LHC, soprattutto in vista di Run-4, il quantitativo di dati gestiti dai centri di calcolo aumenter{\`a} notevolmente.
In questo contesto, la HEP Software Foundation ha redatto un Community White Paper (CWP) che indica il percorso da seguire nell'evoluzione del software moderno e dei modelli di calcolo in preparazione alla fase cosiddetta di High Luminosity di LHC. Questo lavoro ha individuato in tecniche di Big Data Analytics un enorme potenziale per affrontare le sfide future di HEP.

Uno degli sviluppi riguarda la cosiddetta Operation Intelligence, ovvero la ricerca di un aumento nel livello di automazione all'interno dei workflow. Questo genere di approcci potrebbe portare al passaggio da un sistema di manutenzione reattiva ad uno, pi{\`u} evoluto, di manutenzione predittiva o addirittura prescrittiva.

La tesi presenta il lavoro fatto in collaborazione con il centro di calcolo dell'INFN-CNAF per introdurre un sistema di ingestione, organizzazione e processing dei log del centro su una piattaforma di Big Data Analytics unificata, al fine di prototipizzare un modello di manutenzione predittiva per il centro. Questa tesi contribuisce a tale progetto con lo sviluppo di un algoritmo di clustering dei messaggi di log basato su misure di similarit{\`a} tra campi testuali, per superare il limite connesso alla verbosit{\`a} ed eterogeneit{\`a} dei log raccolti dai vari servizi operativi 24/7 al centro.},

    abstract = {Finding useful patterns in large datasets has attracted considerable interest recently, and one of the most widely studied problems in this area is the identification of clusters, or densely populated regions, in a multi-dimensional dataset. Prior work does not adequately address the problem of large datasets and minimization of I/O costs.This paper presents a data clustering method named BIRCH (Balanced Iterative Reducing and Clustering using Hierarchies), and demonstrates that it is especially suitable for very large databases. BIRCH incrementally and dynamically clusters incoming multi-dimensional metric data points to try to produce the best quality clustering with the available resources (i.e., available memory and time constraints). BIRCH can typically find a good clustering with a single scan of the data, and improve the quality further with a few additional scans. BIRCH is also the first clustering algorithm proposed in the database area to handle "noise" (data points that are not part of the underlying pattern) effectively.We evaluate BIRCH's time/space efficiency, data input order sensitivity, and clustering quality through several experiments. We also present a performance comparisons of BIRCH versus CLARANS, a clustering method proposed recently for large datasets, and show that BIRCH is consistently superior.},

    abstract = {Cluster analysis is a primary method for database mining. It is either used as a stand-alone tool to get insight into the distribution of a data set, e.g. to focus further analysis and data processing, or as a preprocessing step for other algorithms operating on the detected clusters. Almost all of the well-known clustering algorithms require input parameters which are hard to determine but have a significant influence on the clustering result. Furthermore, for many real-data sets there does not even exist a global parameter setting for which the result of the clustering algorithm describes the intrinsic clustering structure accurately. We introduce a new algorithm for the purpose of cluster analysis which does not produce a clustering of a data set explicitly; but instead creates an augmented ordering of the database representing its density-based clustering structure. This cluster-ordering contains information which is equivalent to the density-based clusterings corresponding to a broad range of parameter settings. It is a versatile basis for both automatic and interactive cluster analysis. We show how to automatically and efficiently extract not only 'traditional' clustering information (e.g. representative points, arbitrary shaped clusters), but also the intrinsic clustering structure. For medium sized data sets, the cluster-ordering can be represented graphically and for very large data sets, we introduce an appropriate visualization technique. Both are suitable for interactive exploration of the intrinsic clustering structure offering additional insights into the distribution and correlation of the data.},

    ABSTRACT={With the growth of online social network platforms and applications, large amounts of textual user-generated content are created daily in the form of comments, reviews, and short-text messages. As a result, users often find it challenging to discover useful information or more on the topic being discussed from such content. Machine learning and natural language processing algorithms are used to analyze the massive amount of textual social media data available online, including topic modeling techniques that have gained popularity in recent years. This paper investigates the topic modeling subject and its common application areas, methods, and tools. Also, we examine and compare five frequently used topic modeling methods, as applied to short textual social data, to show their benefits practically in detecting important topics. These methods are latent semantic analysis, latent Dirichlet allocation, non-negative matrix factorization, random projection, and principal component analysis. Two textual datasets were selected to evaluate the performance of included topic modeling methods based on the topic quality and some standard statistical evaluation metrics, like recall, precision, F-score, and topic coherence. As a result, latent Dirichlet allocation and non-negative matrix factorization methods delivered more meaningful extracted topics and obtained good results. The paper sheds light on some common topic modeling methods in a short-text context and provides direction for researchers who seek to apply these methods.}

abstract = {A new graphical display is proposed for partitioning techniques. Each cluster is represented by a so-called silhouette, which is based on the comparison of its tightness and separation. This silhouette shows which objects lie well within their cluster, and which ones are merely somewhere in between clusters. The entire clustering is displayed by combining the silhouettes into a single plot, allowing an appreciation of the relative quality of the clusters and an overview of the data configuration. The average silhouette width provides an evaluation of clustering validity, and might be used to select an â€˜appropriateâ€™ number of clusters.}
