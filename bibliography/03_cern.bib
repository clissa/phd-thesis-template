	abstract = {The ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider reads out particle collision data from over 100 million electronic channels at a rate of approximately 100 kHz, with a recording rate for physics events of approximately 1 kHz. Before being certified for physics analysis at computer centres worldwide, the data must be scrutinised to ensure they are clean from any hardware or software related issues that may compromise their integrity. Prompt identification of these issues permits fast action to investigate, correct and potentially prevent future such problems that could render the data unusable. This is achieved through the monitoring of detector-level quantities and reconstructed collision event characteristics at key stages of the data processing chain. This paper presents the monitoring and assessment procedures in place at ATLAS during 2015–2018 data-taking. Through the continuous improvement of operational procedures, ATLAS achieved a high data quality efficiency, with 95.6\% of the recorded proton-proton collision data collected at √s=13 TeV certified for physics analysis.}

ABSTRACT={As a joint effort from various communities involved in the Worldwide LHC Computing Grid, the Operational Intelligence project aims at increasing the level of automation in computing operations and reducing human interventions. The distributed computing systems currently deployed by the LHC experiments have proven to be mature and capable of meeting the experimental goals, by allowing timely delivery of scientific results. However, a substantial number of interventions from software developers, shifters, and operational teams is needed to efficiently manage such heterogenous infrastructures. Under the scope of the Operational Intelligence project, experts from several areas have gathered to propose and work on “smart” solutions. Machine learning, data mining, log analysis, and anomaly detection are only some of the tools we have evaluated for our use cases. In this community study contribution, we report on the development of a suite of operational intelligence services to cover various use cases: workload management, data management, and site operations.}

Given the widely distributed nature of the organisation, and the spread of expertise for installing, configuring, managing and troubleshooting the grid middleware services, a standard centralized model could not be deployed in EGEE. This paper presents the model used in EGEE for building a reliable infrastructure for user, virtual organisation and operations support. The model for supporting a production quality infrastructure for scientific applications will be described in detail. The advantages of the chosen model will be presented and the possible difficulties will be discussed. We will describe the ongoing efforts to build a worldwide grid user support infrastructure in the framework of WLCG by achieving interoperability between the EGEE and OSG user support systems. In this paper we will also describe a scheme of how knowledge management can be used in grid user support and first steps towards a realisation in the framework of the EGEE user support infrastructure.}
