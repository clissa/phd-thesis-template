\section{History of Data Science}
\label{chap:historyDS}

The first trace of this debate dates back to \cite{tukey1962future}, where Tukey uses the term \emph{data analysis} to indicate a discipline with the connotations of a \emph{science} and which is \textquote{defined by a ubiquitous problem rather than by a concrete subject}. 
Tukey's description incorporates many aspects seemingly tied closely to applied statistics: 
\begin{displayquote}
procedures for analyzing data, techniques for interpreting the results of such procedures, ways of planning the gathering of data to make its analysis easier, more precise or more accurate, and all the machinery and results of (mathematical) statistics which apply to analyzing data.
\end{displayquote}
Nevertheless, the extent Tukey attributes to data analysis is broader than its philological meaning, as it comprises all of statistics and embeds it in a larger entity \cite{huber2012data, donoho201750years}.
Indeed, Tukey himself sets the boundaries between data analysis and statistics in their respective binding to the strict formalism of mathematics.

In fact, he appeals for a looser attachment to mathematical foundations and suggests focusing on actionable insights rather than theory.
 - scope and usefulness over security
 - inadequate evidence shall suggest right answers
 - maths as judgment rather than proof
 
Finally, Tukey identified four driving forces in the emerging data analysis science:
Four major influences act on data analysis today:
1. The formal theories of statistics
2. Accelerating developments in computers and display devices
3. The challenge, in many fields, of more and ever larger bodies of data
4. The emphasis on quantification in an ever wider variety of disciplines

Despite being released 60 years ago, Tukey's description is incredibly modern and well depicts many activities currently under the umbrella of what we refer to as data science today.
Nonetheless, researchers and practitioners are yet to reach a complete agreement on its definition.

By and large, bla bla bla...
